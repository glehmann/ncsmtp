Null Client SMTP daemon with aliases support

A null client is a machine that can only send mail. It receives no
mail from the network, and it does not deliver any mail locally.

This program accepts mail and sends it to the mail hub. It can manage
aliases, feature which is useful if mail hub administrator and local host
administrator are not the same person, or if accounts are different on
local host and on mail hub.

 + logs mail transfers on local host
 + lets you keep the default smtp configuration (localhost:smtp) of
   lots of softs
